[Verse 1: Jungkook, V]
Twinkling starlight
Building with blinking light
We're shining brightly
In our own rooms, in our own stars

[Verse 2: J-Hope, RM, Suga]
One light is ambition
Some light is rebellion
People's lights
All are precious
This dark night (Don't be lonely)
Like stars (We shine)
Don't disappear
'Cause you're a big existence
Let us shine

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
Perhaps the reason this night looks so beautiful
Is not because of these stars or lights, but us

[Chorus: Jimin, Jungkook]
You got me
I dream while looking at you
I got you
Inside those pitch black nights
The lights we saw in each other
Were saying the same thing

[Hook: Jungkook]
Starlight that shines brighter in the darkest night
Starlight that shines brighter in the darkest night
The deeper the night, the brighter the starlight

[Verse 3: RM]
One history in one person
One star in one person
7 billion different worlds
Shining with 7 billion lights

[Verse 4: Suga]
7 billion lives, the city's night view
Is possibly another city's night
Our own dreams, let us shine
You shine brighter than anyone else
One

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jungkook]
Perhaps the reason this night looks so beautiful
Is not because of these stars or lights, but us

[Chorus: Jin, V]
You got me
I dream while looking at you
I got you
Inside those pitch black nights
The lights we saw in each other
Were saying the same thing

[Hook: Jin, V]
Starlight that shines brighter in the darkest night
Starlight that shines brighter in the darkest night
The deeper the night, the brighter the starlight

[Bridge: V, Jin, Jungkook]
City lights, this city's star
I remember the night sky I saw when I was young
Where people are light
Where people are stars
In this place full of where
People are lights
We shinin'

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
You got me
I breathe while looking at you
I got you
Inside those pitch black nights

[Outro: Jin, Jungkook, All]
Shine, dream, smile
Oh let us light up the night
We shine in our own ways
Shine, dream, smile
Oh let us light up the night
We shine just the way we are
Tonight

Na na na na na na

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
